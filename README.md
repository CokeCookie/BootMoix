# BootMoix

Simple Shutdown/Reboot Homebrew for Nintendo Switch using libnx  
  
This is a slightly modified version of a [libnx example](https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples) that uses calls to the bpc service to Shutdown/Reboot your Switch.  
Just download a release or compile it yourself. Use with hbmenu like any other homebrew.
